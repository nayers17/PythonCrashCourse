# Here I am defining a variable named "name" and assigning it the value of "Evan Slaski"

name = "Evan Slaski"

# below, I am using the print function to return the value of "name" value 
# and using methods such as lower(), upper(), and title() to change the casing
# on the print function that directly affects the capitalization on the string value
print(name.lower())
print(name.upper())
print(name.title())
